  @class Activity
  @brief An activity is an isolated screen with content drawn onto it or a unique scene in a game

  Every scene in your application must inherit Activity to work with the Swoosh library.

  An activity has 8 unique lifecycle events that can be overriden:
    - onStart , called once when this activity begins for the first time
    - onExit  , called once before this activity is deleted
    - onEnter , called when this activity is entering the view during a segue
    - onResume, called when this activity has finished entering the view after a segue
    - onLeave , called when this activity is leaving the view during a segue
    - onEnd   , called when the activity has finished leaving a view after a segue
    - onUpdate, called every tick while still in view
    - onDraw  , called every tick while still in view *
    
    * some segues may optimize and skip draw calls (see: class WhiteWashFade)
